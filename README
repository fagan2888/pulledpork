Thank you for choosing to use pulled_pork!  This file provides some basic guidance on usage of pulled_pork.

-=Command Usage Reference=-

Usage:	pulledpork.pl [-lvvVdaT? -help] -c <config filename> -o <rule output path> 	/
	-O <oinkcode> -s <so_rule output directory> -D <Distro> -S <SnortVer> 	/
	-p <path to your snort binary> -C <path to your snort.conf> -t <sostub output path>

	Used to fetch and validate latest Snort rules from snort.org.

	Options:
	-c	Where the pulledpork config file lives.
	-i	Where the disablesid config file lives.
	-o	Where do you want me to put generic rules files?
	-O	What is your Oinkcode?
	-T	Process text based rules files only, i.e. DO NOT process so_rules
	-s	Where do you want me to put the so_rules?
	-m where do you want me to put the sid-msg.map file?
	-S	Specify your Snort version
		Valid options for this value 2.8.0.1,2.8.0.2,2.8.1,2.8.2,2.8.2.1,2.8.2.2,2.8.3,2.8.3.1,2.8.3.2,2.8.4,2.8.4.1
	-C	Path to your snort.conf
	-p	Path to your Snort binary
	-P	Path to your tar binary
	-t	Where do you want me to put the so_rule stub files? ** Thus MUST be uniquely different from the -o option value
	-D	What Distro are you running on, for the so_rules
		Valid Distro Types=CentOS-4.6,CentOS-5.0,Debian-Lenny,FC-5,FC-9,FreeBSD-7.0,RHEL-5.0,Ubuntu-6.01.1,Ubuntu-8.04
	-l	Log information to logger rather than stdout messages.  **not yet implemented**
	-v	Verbose mode, you know.. for troubleshooting and such nonsense.
	-vv	EXTRA Verbose mode, you know.. for in-depth troubleshooting and other such nonsense.
	-d	Do not verify signature of rules tarball, why though?.
	-H	Send a SIGHUP to the pids listed in the config file
	-n	Do everything other than download of new files (disablesid, etc)
	-V	Print Version and exit
	-help/?	Print the help info.


-=Basic Usage Examples=-

A simple example of how to use pulled_pork would be to specify all of your configuration directives inside of the
pulled_pork.conf file.  Specifically for minimal function, i.e. NO Shared Object rule processing you must define 
at a minimum the rule_file, oinkcode, temp_path, tar_path, and rule_path values.  Below are some examples of this. 

./pulledpork.pl -o /usr/local/etc/snort/rules/ -O 12345667778523452344234234  \
-f snortrules-snapshot-2.8_s.tar.gz -i disablesid.conf -T -H

The above will fetch the snortrules-snapshot-2.8_s.tar.gz tarball from snort.org using the specified oinkcode of 
12345667778523452344234234 and put the rules files from that tarball into the output path of 
/usr/local/etc/snort/rules/ while the -i option tells pulledpork where the
disablesid.conf lives, and the -T option tells pulledpork to not process for any shared object rules and the final
-H option tells pulledpork to send a Hangup signal to the snort pid that you defned in the pulledpork.conf.

./pulledpork.pl -c pulledpork.conf -i disablesid.conf -T -H

Similar to the first example but all options specified in the pulledpork.conf file (other than disablesid and -H)...

./pulledpork.pl -c pulledpork.conf -i disablesid.conf -m /usr/local/etc/snort/sid-msg.map -Hn

The above will simply read the disablesid and disable as defined, then send a Hangup signal after generating the sid-msg.map
at the specified location without downloading anything.
Highly useful when tuning / making changes etc..

I'll probably add more info later, the --help or --? will display all runtime options and the pulledpork.conf is
pretty well annotated... so if you can't figure it out... try harder!  And once you figure it out, please feel 
free to contribute with additional readme / help foo.. thx!

As a side note, I would like to give a shout-out to my buddy Bruce for aiding in the naming of pulled_pork!
"hopefully that will shut him up ;-)"
