Thank you for choosing to use pulled_pork!  This file provides some basic guidance on usage of pulled_pork.

-=Basic Usage=-

A simple example of how to use pulled_pork would be to specify all of your configuration directives inside of the
pulled_pork.conf file.  Specifically for minimal function, i.e. NO Shared Object rule processing you must define 
at a minimum the rule_file, oinkcode, temp_path, tar_path, and rule_path values.  Below are some examples of this. 

./pulledpork.pl -o /usr/local/etc/snort/rules/ -O 12345667778523452344234234  \
-f snortrules-snapshot-2.8_s.tar.gz -T

The above will fetch the snortrules-snapshot-2.8_s.tar.gz tarball from snort.org using the specified oinkcode of 
12345667778523452344234234 and put the rules files from that tarball into the output path of 
/usr/local/etc/snort/rules/ and the -T option tells pulledpork to not process for any shared object rules.

./pulledpork.pl -c pulledpork.conf -T

Similar to the first example but all options specified in the pulledpork.conf file...

I'll probably add more info later, the --help or --? will display all runtime options and the pulledpork.conf is
pretty well annotated... so if you can't figure it out... try harder!  And once you figure it out, please feel 
free to contribute with additional readme / help foo.. thx!
