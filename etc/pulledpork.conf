# Config file for pulledpork
# Be sure to read through the entire configuration file
# If you specify any of these items on the command line, it WILL take 
# precedence over any value that you specify in this file!

#######
#######  The below section defines what your oinkcode is (required for 
#######  VRT rules), defines a temp path (must be writable) and also 
#######  defines what version of rules that you are getting (for your 
#######  snort version and subscription etc...)
####### 

# The rule_url value replaces the old base_url and rule_file configuration
# options.  You can now specify one or as many rule_urls as you like, they 
# must appear as http://what.site.com/|rulesfile.tar.gz|1234567.  You can specify
# each on an individual line, or you can specify them in a , separated list
# i.e. rule_url=http://x.y.z/|a.tar.gz|123,http://z.y.z/|b.tar.gz|456
# note that the url, rule file, and oinkcode itself are separated by a pipe |
# i.e. url|tarball|123456789, if you do not have an ET PRO feed, set the <et oinkcode>
# value to "open" and you will get the open source version!
rule_url=https://www.snort.org/reg-rules/|snortrules-snapshot.tar.gz|<oinkcode>
rule_url=http://rules.emergingthreats.net/|emerging.rules.tar.gz|<et oinkcode>
# NOTE above that the VRT snortrules-snapshot does not contain the version
# portion of the tarball name, this is because PP now automatically populates
# this value for you, if, however you put the version information in, PP will
# NOT populate this value but will use your value!


# Specify the rule categories to ignore from the tarball, these defaults are
# a pretty good starting place. These must be comma separated and have no spaces.
# Note that these are based on the VRT ruleset
ignore=deleted,experimental,local
# IMPORTANT, if you are NOT yet using 2.8.6 then you MUST comment out the
# previous ignore line and uncomment the following!
# ignore=deleted,experimental,local,decoder,preprocessor,sensitive-data


# Define your Oinkcode - DEPRICATED, SEE RULE_URL
# oinkcode=replacethiswithyouroinkcode

# What is our temp path, be sure this path has a bit of space for rule 
# extraction and manipulation, no trailing slash
temp_path=/tmp

#######
#######  The below section is for rule processing.  This section is 
#######  required if you are not specifying the configuration using
#######  runtime switches.  Note that runtime switches do SUPERSEED 
#######  any values that you have specified here!
#######

# What path you want the .rules file containing all of the processed 
# rules? (this value has changed as of 0.4.0, previously we copied 
# all of the rules, now we are creating a single large rules file
# but still keeping a separate file for your so_rules!
rule_path=/usr/local/etc/snort/rules/snort.rules

# If you are running any rules in your local.rules file, we need to
# know about them to properly build a sid-msg.map that will contain your
# local.rules metadata (msg) information.  You can specify other rules
# files that are local to your system here by adding a comma and more paths...
# remember that the FULL path must be specified for EACH value.
# local_rules=/path/to/these.rules,/path/to/those.rules
local_rules=/usr/local/etc/snort/rules/local.rules

# Where should I put the sid-msg.map file?
sid_msg=/usr/local/etc/snort/sid-msg.map

# Where do you want me to put the sid changelog?  This is a changelog 
# that pulledpork maintains of all new sids that are imported
sid_changelog=/var/log/sid_changes.log
# this value is optional

#######
#######  The below section is for so_rule processing only.  If you don't
#######  need to use them.. then comment this section out!
#######  Alternately, if you are not using pulledpork to process 
#######  so_rules, you can specify -T at runtime to bypass this altogether
#######

# What path you want the .so files to actually go to *i.e. where is it
# defined in your snort.conf, needs a trailing slash
sorule_path=/usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrules/

# Path to the snort binary, we need this to generate the stub files
snort_path=/usr/local/bin/snort

# We need to know where your snort.conf file lives so that we can
# generate the stub files
config_path=/usr/local/etc/snort/snort.conf

# This is the file that contains all of the shared object rules that pulledpork
# has processed, note that this has changed as of 0.4.0 just like the rules_path!
sostub_path=/usr/local/etc/snort/rules/so_rules.rules

# Define your distro, this is for the precompiled shared object libs!
# Valid Distro Types=Debian-Lenny, Ubuntu-6.01.1, Ubuntu-8.04
# CentOS-4.6, Centos-4-8, CentOS-5.0, Centos-5-4
# FC-5, FC-9, FC-11, FC-12, RHEL-5.0
# FreeBSD-6.3, FreeBSD-7-2, FreeBSD-7-3, FreeBSD-7.0, FreeBSD-8-0, FreeBSD-8-1
distro=FreeBSD-8.0

#######  This next section is optional, but probably pretty useful to you.
#######  Effectively list the path to the pid files that you want 
#######  us to send a HUP signal to after we run, i.e. snort, barnyard, 
#######  barnyard2 etc..  This list should be separated by comas only
#######  HINT: Unless you have specified the pid file for snort, it is
#######  generally snort_int.pid where int is the sniffing interface
#######  The same is true for barnyard2 (it is based on snort after all).

# pid_path=/var/run/snort.pid,/var/run/barnyard.pid,/var/run/barnyard2.pid
# and so on...
# pid_path=/var/run/snort_eth0.pid

# This defines the version of snort that you are using, for use ONLY if the 
# proper snort binary is not on the system that you are fetching the rules with
# Defining this value will set the Textonly flag, and thus will NOT allow
# you to use shared object rules.  This value MUST contain all 4 minor version
# numbers.
# snort_version=2.9.0.0

# Here you can specify what rule modification files to run automatically.
# simply uncomment and specify the apt path.
# enablesid=/usr/local/etc/snort/enablesid.conf
# dropsid=/usr/local/etc/snort/dropsid.conf
# disablesid=/usr/local/etc/snort/disablesid.conf
# modifysid=/usr/local/etc/snort/modifysid.conf

# What is the base ruleset that you want to use, please uncomment to use
# and see the README.RULESETS for a description of the options.  
# Note that setting this value will disable all ET rulesets if you are 
# Running such rulesets
# ips_policy=security

####### Remember, a number of these values are optional.. if you don't 
####### need to process so_rules, simply comment out the so_rule section
####### you can also specify -T at runtime to process only GID 1 rules.

version=0.5.0D
